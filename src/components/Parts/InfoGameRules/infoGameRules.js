                    <div>The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.</div><br/>
                    <div>This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few</div>
                    <div>mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.</div>
                    <h2>The Rules</h2>
                    <h3>For a space that is populated:</h3>
                    <div className="infoGameRules-textLine-with-padding-left">Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</div>
                    <div className="infoGameRules-textLine-with-padding-left">Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</div>
                    <div className="infoGameRules-textLine-with-padding-left">Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</div>
                    <h3>For a space that is populated:</h3>
                    <div className="infoGameRules-textLine-with-padding-left">Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</div>
                    <h2>The Controls</h2>
                    <div>Choose a figure from the pull-down menu or make one yourself by clicking on the cells with a mouse. A new generation of cells (corresponding to one iteration of the</div>
                    <div>rules) is initiated by the 'Next' button. The 'Start' button advances the game by several generations. Game speed is regulated by the speed dial and the size of the cells</div>
                    <div>with the size dial.</div><br/>
